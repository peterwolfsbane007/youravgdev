Following the footsteps of [@youravgdev](https://youtube.com/@YourAvgDev/)

> While roaming in the valleys of internet, I have stumbled upon this mountain of knowledge.  
> Some dev, who calls himself an average dev, is on youtube posting stuff related to software development.  
> This ignited a spark in me, a CS student and an internet enthusiast, to learn something continously.
